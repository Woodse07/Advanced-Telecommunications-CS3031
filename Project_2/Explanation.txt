Only people part of my 'group' can decrypt my files..
To all other users files will be encrypted..
Add or remove users..
Asymmetric public key for every user.. used to encrypt a symmetric key..
Symmetric key used to encrypt/decrypt all files..
User can then decrypt their encrypted version of symmetric key..
Can then encrypt/decrypt with their symmetric key..

If user is added:
	1. Create new asymmetric key pair.
	2. Encrypt symmetric key with public asymmetric key.
	3. Give user Encrypted symmetric key and their private key.
	
If user is removed:
	1. Generate a new symmetric key.
	2. Re-encrypt all files.
	3. Re-encyrpt symmetric key for each user.

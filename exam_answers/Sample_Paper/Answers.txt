QUESTION 1:

(a)
Distinguish between UDP and TCP in terms of:
	1. Reliable data transfer.
	2. Header size.
	3. Connection overheads.

For IP Telephony and IP Videoconferencing, which protocol would be preferable? Why?

Answer:

TCP v UDP:
- Reliable data transfer:
	- TCP is very reliable,
	  has no loss, 
	  uses ACK's and selective repeat to error correct.
	
	- UDP is unreliable, 
	  has no acks,
	  detects errors using checksum but has no error correction/recovery.

- Header size:
	- TCP header has at least 20 bytes,
	  requires seq number and ack number,
	  has control flags,
	  checksum,
	  data offset,
	  and window size.

	- UDP header has 8 bytes,
	  only source and destination port numbers,
	  checksum,
	  and data length.

- Connection overheads:
	- TCP has a larger overhead and therefore a slower connection.
	  Error checking and recovery introduce larger overhead but improve reliability.
	
	- UDP has a smaller overhead and therefore a faster connection.
	  Less error detection means smaller overhead but reliability decreases.

TCP or UDP for IP Telephone/Videoconferencing.
- UDP would be preferred for IP telephone and videoconverencing as audio and video can be lossy
  and still understood, but its main priority is speed of transfer which UDP does best as it sends
  information when requested and then forgets about it.


(b)
Draw FSM of corresponding receiver to a FSM for a reliable sender that can handle garbled
ACKs and NAKs
*** IN COPY ***


(c)
With the help of a FSM describe the main building blocks of the TCP Congestion Control Algorithm.
(Required to detail the state transitions in the FSM).

- Congestion Control occurs when too many sources are sending too much data too fast 
  for the network to handle.

- This can result in lost packets (buffer overflow in routers) and long delays (queuing in router).

Building blocks:
- Slow Start:
	- When connection starts, increase rate exponentially until first loss.
	  Initially CWND = 1mss, double every RTT(round trip time).

- Congestion Avoidance.

- Faster Recovery.

(d)
What is the role of a 'web proxy' in a large insitutional network? 
What are the main advantages of installing a proxy server?

- The role of a web proxy is to sit between the institutional network and the origin server
  of the HTTP request.

- A client inside the institution's browser sends all of its HTTP requests to the web proxy server.
	- If the proxy contains the object the browser is looking for in its cache, it is returned.

	- If the proxy doesn't contain the object the browser is looking for, the proxy requests
	  the object from the origin server and then the proxy returns the requests object to 
	  the client's browser.

- Some advantages of using a web proxy:
	- Anonymous browsing:
		- As your internal IP address can't be seen by the external network,
		  only your proxy IP can.

	- Safer browsing:
		- Hackers can't access your internal IP address.

	- Access filtered websites:
		- Changing your web proxy can allow you to access websites otherwise hidden 
		  by your institution proxy.

	- Performance / speed:
		- Proxies act as a cache, storing documents and site requests, speeding up future
		  requests using its cache.

	- Filter requests:
		- Used in institutions to stop malicious downloads, etc.

	- Load balancing: 
		- Can be used in reverse as a load-balancer for sharing workload among several HTTP
		  servers.


(e)
What is a 'websocket' and what are its advantages over technologies such as AJAX and Comet?
Why are websockets more efficient than traditional HTTP exchanges?

- A websocket defines an API establishing a two-way socket connection between a web browser and
  server, where both parties can send data at any time. 

- Advantages over AJAX/Comet:
	- Websockets are event driven, wherease AJAX/Comet are request/response driven.

	- Client and server can emit events and data to each other whenever they need to whereas
	  with AJAX/Comet, each request is given a generated response by a server just like 
	  refreshing a web page.

	- Websockets only establish a connection once, AJAX/Comet establish a new connection with 
	  each request.

	- Websockets are better for real time applications like messaging apps or google docs, as
	  a new connection doesn't need to be made when changes(events) occcur, whereas with 
	  AJAX/Comet it would request a new connection.

- Websockets vs HTTP:
	- Websockets are bi-directional, http is request/response.
	
	- Websockets only require moderate overhead to establish the connection, but each event
	  only requires minimal overhead. By contrast, HTTP requires moderate overhead for every 
	  request/response.



QUESTION 2:
(a)
Describe the ECB(Electronic Code Book) mode used in the DES(Data Encryption Standard) cipher.
How does the CBC(Cipher Block Chaining) mode overcome the block substitution attack of ECB mode.
Explain why the OFB(Output Feedback Mode) is described as being a 'synchrounous stream cipher'.

- ECB Mode (Electronic Code Book)
	- Each 64-bit block encoded independently of other blocks.

	- Block synchronisation between the Tx and Rev not necessary.
	
	- Bit errors from noisy transmission only affect the corresponding blocks.
	
	- Block ciphers operating in ECB can be parallelised to provide high-speed implementations.

- CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)
	- ECB encodes each block independently so can be re-ordered to perform malicious attacks.

	- CBC mode, each plaintext block is XOR'd with the previous ciphertext block before being
	  encrypted, so each block is dependent on all previous blocks.

	- An initilisation vector is used for the first block.

	- The initialisation vector isn't secret as only used once (known as a nonce).

	- Blocks can no longer be re-ordered as they depend on previous blocks.

- OFB (Output Feedback Mode)
	- A block cipher is used to build a stream cipher encryption scheme, the key stream is 
	  generated block-wise rather than bitwise.

	- Cipher outputs B key stream bits, B is width of block cipher.
	  Then encrypt B plaintext bits using XOR operation. 
	  OFB forms a synchronous stream cipher as key stream doesn't depend on the plain or cipher
	  text.

	- Encryption/Decryption are same operation.
	  Doesn't depend on plan/cipher text so we can pre-compute several blocks of key stream
	  material.

(c)
What are the distinguishing characteristics of a Group?
What is the order ord(a) of a group (G, ◦)?
Determine the order of a=3 in Z*_11.
Let G be a finite cyclic group.
Find the number of primitive elements in Z*_5.

- A group is a set of elements G with an operation ◦, which combines two elements of G
  and has properties:
	- Group operation ◦ is closed.. 
		(a ◦ b = c is an element of G, where all values of a,b are elements of G).
	
	- Group operation ◦ is associative..
		(a ◦ (b ◦ c) = (a ◦ b) ◦ c, for all values of a,b,c are elements of G).

	- There exists an identity element..
		(a ◦ I = I ◦ a, for all values of a are elements of G).

	- For each a, there exists a^-1, called inverse of a..
		(a ◦ a^-1 = I)

	- The group is commutative..
		(a ◦ b = b ◦ a for all values of a,b are elements of G).

- The order ord(a) of a group (G, ◦) is the smalled positive integer such that:
	- a^k = a ◦ a ◦ ... ◦ a = 1.

- Order of a=3 in Z*_11:
	- Keep computing powers of 'a' until we obtain identity element 1.
	  a^1 = 3(mod 11) = 3 
	  a^2 = a*a = 3*3 = 9(mod 11) = 9
	  a^3 = a*a*a = 3*3*3 = 27(mod 11) = 5
	  a^4 = a*a*a*a = 3*3*3*3 = 81(mod 11) = 4
	  a^5 = a*a*a*a*a = 3*3*3*3*3 = 243(mod 11) = 1

	- Order = 5!

- Find order of Z*_5..
	- Check if a=2 is primitive element:
	  a^1 = 2
	  a^2 = a*a = 2*2 = 4 
	  a^3 = a*a*a = 2*2*2 = 8 = 3(mod 5)
	  a^4 = a*a*a*a = 2*2*2*2 = 16 = 1(mod 5)
	  
	- Order = 4.

	- Number of primitive elements = Φ(|G|)
	  If |G| is prime, all elements but 1 are primitive
	  as |G| = 4
	  Φ(4) = (2^2 - 2^1) = 2
	
	- Therefore there are 2 primitive elements of Z*_5


(d)
Describe in detail the cryptographic techniques used to achieve 'distributed consensus' in the 
Bitcoin network using the proof-of-word (PoW) algorithm.
What are the limiting factors of the scheme?

To do...


(e)
Given the elliptic curve E over Z_17 and the base point P=(5,1):
	E : y^2 = x^3 + 4x + 20 mod 17
Calculate the following point multiplication 2P using the formulae provided below:
	x3 = s^2 - x1 - x2 mod p
	y3 = s(x1 - x3) - y1 mod p
where:
	s = ((y2-y1)/(x2-x1) mod p).. if P != Q (point addition)
	  
	  = ((3x1^2 + a)/(2y1) mod p).. if P = Q (point doubling)

You are required to show the extended euclidean algorithm (EEA) calculation for computing the 
multiplication inverse.

Answer:
- Because we are only given 1 point P=(5,1), we can't use point addition. 
  We must use point doubling. 
  P=(5,1), x1=5, y1=1.. a=4(why?)
  
  Point doubling:
  s = ((3x1^2 + a)/(2y1) mod p)... ((3(5)^2 + 4)/(2*1) mod 17)
    = 39.5 mod 17
    = 5.5

  x3 = s^2 - x1 - x1 mod p... (5.5)^2 - 2(5) mod 17
     = 20.25 mod 17
     = 3.25

  y3 = s(x1-x3) - y1 mod p... (5.5)(5-3.25) - 1 mode 17
     = 8.625 mod 17
     = 8.625

  R = (3.25,8.625)

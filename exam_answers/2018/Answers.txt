QUESTION 1:
(a)
What is the role of a 'web proxy' in a large institutional network?
What are the main advantages of a proxy server?

Answer:
- The role of a web proxy is to sit between the institutional network and the origin server of the 
  HTTP request.

- A client inside the institutional network sens all of its HTTP requests to the web proxy.
	- If the proxy contains the object being requested in its cache, it returns it.
	
	- If the proxy doesn't contain the requested object in its cache, it forwards the 
	  request to the origin server and then returns the response to the client.

- Some advantages of a web proxy:
	- Anonymous browsing:
		- As your internal IP address can't be seen by the external network, only
		  your proxy ip.

	- Safer browsing:
		- Hackers can't access your internal IP address.

	- Access filtered websites:
		- Changing your web proxy can allow you to access websites otherwise hidden 
		  by your institution proxy.

	- Performance/Speed:
		 - Using a proxy acts like a cache, storing objects that are frequently requested,
		   speeding up future requests.

	- Filter requests:
		- Used in institutions to stop malicious downloads, etc.

	- Load balancing:
		- Can be used in reverse to share the workload among several HTTP servers.


(b)
Given the network and associated assumptions in the figure below, calculate:
	- The LAN Utilization
	- Access Link Utilization
	- Total Delay

Now assume that we install a web proxy server into the institutional network with a hit
rate of 40%, calculate:
	- Access Link Utilization
	- Total Delay

Assumptions:
	- Avg object size: 					100k bits
	- Avg request rate from browsers to origin servers: 	15 requests/sec
	- Avg data rate to browsers: 				1.5Mbps
	- RTT from institutional router to any origin server:	2 sec (Internet delay)
	- Access link rate: 					1.54 Mbps

Describe the basic server hierarchy within the domain name system (DNS).
Describe how DNSSEC validation takes place within a zone by detailing the various Resource Records
(RRs), RRsets and Signature Keys that are required to secure a domain. 
*(DNSSEC = Domain Name System Security Extensions)

Answer:
- DNS is a distributed database implemented in a hierarchy of many name servers.
	- Root name servers are contacted by local name servers that cannot resolve a name.
 	  The root name server returns a list of IP address for responsible TLD servers.
	  Root domain symbolized by a '.'

	- Top level domain(TLD) servers are responsible for com, org, net, edu, etc. and all top
	  level country domains.
	
	- Authorative DNS servers organise their own DNS servers, providing authoritative hostname
	  to IP mappings for the organisations' names hosts. They can be maintained by an 
	  organisation or service provider.
	  'army.mil'

	- Can be split further down into zones (e.g.) 'washington.army.mil'

- DNSSEC Validation:		
	- Request desired RRset, which returns corresponding RRSIG record.
	- Request DNSKEY records containing public ZSK and public KSK,
	  which returns the RRSIG for the DNSKEY RRset.
	- Verify the RRSIG of the requested RRset with the public ZSK.
	- Verify the RRSIG of the DNSKEY RRset with the public KSK.


(d)
What is a 'websocket' and what are its advantages over technologies such as AJAX and Comet?
Why are websockets more efficient than traditional HTTP exchanges?

- A websocket defines an API establishing a two-way socket connection between a web browser and
  server, where both parties can send data at any time.

- Advantages over AJAX/Comet:
	- Websockets are event driven, whereas AJAX/Comet are request/response driven.

	- Client and server can emit events and data to eachother whenever they need to, wherease
	  with AJAX/Comet each request is given a generated response by a server just like 
	  refreshing a web page.

	- Websockets only establish a connection once, AJAX/Comet establish a new connection
	  with each request.

	- Websockets are better for real time applications like messaging apps or google docs, as
	  a new connection doesn't need to be made every time a change occurs, whereas with 
	  AJAX/Comet it would request a new connection.

- Websockets vs HTTP:
	- Websockets are bi-directional, http is request/response.

	- Websockets only require a moderate amount of overhead to establish a connection, and 
	  minimal overhead for each event. By contrase HTTP requires moderate overhead for every
	  request/response.


(e)
Describe in detail the main components of a X.509 certificate.
Explain the 'handshake' procedure used in the secure sockets layer (SSL) protocol to establish
a secure tunnel between a web browser and server. 

Answer:
-The TTP(Trusted Third Party) constructs a message referred to as a certificate:

	| Subject | Public Key | Validity Period | Issuer | Other Fields | Signature of TTP |

	- Contains a digital signature on the other fields with the private key of the TTP.
	  This system assumes that every user is equipped with the public key of the TTP. This
	  allows everyone to verify the digital signature on the certificate, guaranteeing that the
	  public key is assosciated with the named user.

-SSL Handshake:
	-The client sends:
		- List of algorithms it supports.
		- Client nonce.

	- The server sends back:
		- Choice of algorithms
		- Certificate
		- Server Nonce

	- The client:
		- Verifies the certificate
		- Extracts the server's public key
		- Generates pre_master_secret
		- Encrypts pre_master_secret with server's public key
		- Sends the encrypted master secret to server

	- The client and server independently compute the encryption keys and MAC keys from 
	  pre_master_secret and the nonces.

	- The client sends a MAC of all the handshake messages.

	- The server sends a MAC of all the handshake messages.

	- This is all done to make sure that no one has changed the sequence of events.
	  The final two steps prevent a MITM attack from deleting stronger algorithms from the list.


	
QUESTION 2:
(a)
List the main components of an electronic mail system and describe the functionality of each.
Distinguish between the POP, IMAP, and Webmail protocols.
What do you understand by the term 'stateless protocol'?
Is IMAP stateless?

Answer:
- Electronic Mail System:
	- Three major components:
		- User Agents.
		- Mail Servers.
		- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol(SMTP).

	- User Agents:
		- Me and you?

	- Mail Servers:
		- A mailbox contains incoming messages for the user.
		
		- A message queue contains outgoing mail messages
		
		- SMTP protocol is used to send email messages between mail servers.

	- SMTP:
		- Uses TCP to reliably transfer email messages from the client to the 
		  server on port 25.

		- Messages are usually in 7-bit ASCII format.

		- Direct transfer - sending server to receiving server.

		- Three phases of transfer:
			1. Handshaking
			2. Transfer of messages
			3. Closure

		- Uses a command/response interaction (like http, ftp)
		  Commands: ASCII text
		  Response: Status code and phrase.

		- SMTP process:
			1. User agent sends message to their mail server.. placed in queue.
			2. Client side of SMTP opens TCP connection with recipients mail server.
			3. SMTP client sends users message over TCP.
			4. Recipient's mail server places the message in the recipient's mailbox.
			5. Recipient invokes their UA to read the message.

- Mail access protocols:
	- SMTP: Delivery/Storage to receiver's server.

	- Mail Access Protocol: Retrieval from server.
	
	- Post Office Protocol(POP): Authorisation, Download.

	- Internet Mail Access Protocol(IMAP): More features, including manipulation of 
					       stored messages on the server.

	- HTTP: Gmail, Hotmail, etc.

- Stateless protocol:
	- A protocol that maintains no information about past clients' requests.
	
	- Each command is executed independently, without any knowledge of the commands 
	  that came before it.

- IMAP is not a stateless protocol.
	- IMAP keeps all messages in one place on the server.

	- Allows users to organise messages in folders.

	- Keeps user state accross sessions.


(b)
Draw the finite state machine (FSM) for the 3-way TCP handshake from both the client and
server perspectives (required to detail the state transitions in the FSM).

(c)
What is the 'SYN Flood Attack' in TCP?
Describe in detail as to how this attack can be mitigated using 'Syn Cookies'

- Syn Flood attack is a type of Denial of Services attack. 
	- An attacker sends a large number of TCP SYN segments without completing the third
	  handshake step, eventually taking up all of the servers resources and disallowing
	  anyone else from making a handshake.

- This attack be mitigated using SYN cookies.
	- The server does not know if a SYN segment is coming from a legitimate user.
	 
	- The server creates an initial sequence number (ISN) or cookie from the hash of:
		- Source IP address & port number
		
		- Destination IP address & port number

		- Timestamp

	- The server sends a SYNACK but maintains no state information corresponding to the SYN.
	  It then drops the connection.

	- A legitimate client will return an ACK segment, using the cookie information (ISN+1)
	  in the ACK.
	  The connection is established.


(d)
With the help of a FSM describe the main building blocks of the TCP Congestion Control algorithm. 
You are required to detail the state transitions in the FSM.

- TCP Congestion Control:
	- The sender limits transmission:
		- Send cwnd bytes - a function of network congestion (i.e.) dynamic.

		- Wait one RTT for ACKs.

		- Send more bytes.

What is Fermat's Little Theorem and why is it useful in the context of primality testing?
Show that 29 is a prime number using Fermat's theorem.
In the context of primality testing, Fermat's Little Theorem can produce false positives..
What can be done to mitigate this problem?

- Fermat's Little Theorem states that if 'p' is a prime number, then for any integer 'a',
  the number a^p - a is an integer multiple of p.
	- Let a be an integer and p a prime, then:
	  a^p ≡ a mod p
	  a^(p-1) ≡ 1 mod p
	  a*a^(p-2) ≡ 1 mod p
	  a^(-1) ≡ a^(p-2) mod p

	- We now have a way for inverting an integer 'a' modulo a prime 'p'.
	
	- We can use this to show that 29 is a prime number.
	  let p = 29 and a = 2
	  2^29 = 536870912
	  536870912 - 2 = 536870910.. which is an integer multiple of 29.

- I think this is the best method:
	- Pick a number for a such that 1 < a < prime(29).. lets say 2.
	-  a^(n-1) = 2^28 ≡ 1 (mod 29) 
	- This holds true.. but we try again for different a, such that 1 < a < 29, in case
	  the number we picked is a Fermat liar.
	- let a = 3.
	- a^(n-1) = 3^28 ≡ 1 (mod 29)
	- This holds true, so we know 29 must be prime.
            
- How to mitigate false positives?
	- Test again with different value for a.
	  Perhaps test multipe times for multiple different values?

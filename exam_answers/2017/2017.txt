QUESTION 1:
(a)
Suppose Client A requests a web page from Server S through HTTP and its socket is assosciated
with port 33000.

(i) What are the src and dest ports for the segments sent from A to S?

(ii) Can Client A contact Server S using UDP as the transport protocol?

(iii) Can Client A request multiple resources in a single TCP connection?

Answer:
(i)
The source port will be 33000.
The destination port will be the port assosciated with the socket of S.

(ii)
Typically you wouldn't do this but it is possible.
The reason you wouldn't want to do this is because UDP is unreliable. 

(iii)
Yes, this can be done over a persistent HTTP connection. 

(b)
Describe the basic server hierarchy within the DNS.
Outline the minimum steps required in terms of DNS entries (including web and email domains), 
that are required to register your new start-up 'net-workutopia.com'

Answer:
- Root servers resolve top level domains (.ie, .com, .org, ...)
	- TLDs responsilbe for their respective subdomains(google.ie, ...)
		- Authoritative servers are responsible for their subdomains(foo.bar.net, ...)

- Register the new name at a DNS registrar:
	- Provide names and IP addresses of the authoritative name server(primary and secondary).
	  Registrar inserts two RRs into .com TLD server:
	 	- [website.com, NS, dns1.website.com]
		- [nds1.website.com, A, 212.212.212.1]
	- Create:
		- Autoritative server type A record for www.website.com
		- Type MX record for website.com
		  [mail1.website.com, A, 212.212.212.2]

(c)
What are the services provided by the DNSSEC protocol?
Describe how DNSSEC validation takes place within a zone by detailing the various RRs, RRsets
and Signature Keys that are required to secure a domain. 

Answer:
Prodives origin authenticity and integrity assurance for DNS data by making use of 
digital signatures.

DNSSEC add a number of new RR types such as:
	- RRSIG:	Contains a cyprtographic signature
	- DNSKEY:	Contains a public signing key
	- DS:		Contains a has of a DNSKEY record

The first step towards securing a zone with DNSSEC is to group all records of the same type 
into a RRset (e.g.) All AAAA records are bundled into a AAAA RRset.

DNSSEC Validation:
	- Request the desired RRset, which returns the corresponding RRSIG record.
	- Request the DNSKEY record conatinig the public ZSK and public KSK, which
	  returns the RRSIG for the DNSKEY RRset.
	- Verify the RRSIG of the requested RRset with the public ZSK.
	- Verify the RRSIG of the DNSKEY RRset with the public KSK.

(d)
Distinguish between centralized and decentralized P2P services.

Answer:
Decentralised P2P network interconnects nodes sharing resources amongst each other without any
centralised server. 
Decentralised P2P networks prioritise robustness and security, not single point of failure. 
Centralised P2P networks have a central server.

(e)
Consider distributing a file F = 15Gbits to N peers.
The server has an upload rate of u_s = 30Mbps
Each peer has a download rate of di = 2 Mbps and un upload rate of u.
for N = 1000 and u = 2Mbps, calculate the min distribution time for both client-server and
P2P configs.

Answer:

Client-Server:
- Server must sequentially send N file copies:
	- Time to send one copy = F/u_s
	- Time so send N copies = N*(F/u_s)

- Each client must download the file copy:
	- Min client download rate = d_min
	- Min client download time = F/d_min	

- F = File Size
- u_s = File upload speed

- Time to distribute F to N clients:
	- D_cs >= max{N*(F/u_s), F/d_min}

F increases linearly in N.

F = 15 Gbits = 15,000 Mbits
u_s = 30 Mbps
di = 2 Mbps
N = 1,000
u = 2 Mbps

Time to send N copies = 1000 * (15,000/30) = 500,000s
Min client download time = 15,000 / 2 = 7,500
D_cs >= max{500,000, 7,500}
D_cs >= 500,000


Peer-to-Peer:
- Server must upload at least one copy:
	- Time to send one copy = F/u_s

- Each client must download the file copy:
	- Min download time = F/d_min

- As aggregate must download N*F bits:
	- Max upload rate = u_s + sumof(ui)

Time to distribute F to N client:
D_p2p >= max{F/u_s, F/d_min, (N*F)/(u_s+sumof(ui))}

F increases linearly in N, but so does sumof(ui), as each peer brings server capacity. 

Time to send one copy = 15,000/30 = 500
Min Download time = 15,000/2 = 7,500
Max upload rate = 30 + 2000 = 2030

D_p2p >= max{500, 7,500, (1000*15000)/(2030)}
D_p2p >= max{500, 7,500, 7,389}
D_p2p >= 7,500
